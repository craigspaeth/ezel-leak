# Ezel-leak

An app to test out what is causing a memory leak in an Ezel boilerplate app.

## Theories

* Backbone super sync
  * Adding a `.timeout(2000)` definitely flattens out memory consumption. Long haning requests clearly blow up memory.
  * Deferreds also hang on to memory
  * Closures withing backbone-super-sync? e.g. `error`, `success`, `send`
